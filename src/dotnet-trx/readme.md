## Open Source Maintenance Fee

To ensure the long-term sustainability of this project, use of dotnet-trx requires an 
[Open Source Maintenance Fee](https://opensourcemaintenancefee.org). While the source 
code is freely available under the terms of the 
[MIT License](https://github.com/devlooped/dotnet-trx/blob/main/license.txt), 
this package and other aspects of the project require 
[adherence to the Maintenance Fee](https://github.com/devlooped/dotnet-trx/blob/main/osmfeula.txt).

In short, if you use this project to generate revenue, the [Maintenance Fee is required](https://github.com/devlooped/dotnet-trx/blob/main/osmfeula.txt).

To pay the Maintenance Fee, [become a Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/devlooped) at the corresponding OSMF tier (starting at just $10!).
